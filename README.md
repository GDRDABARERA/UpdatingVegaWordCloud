Real time Updating Vega word Cloud


This code shows, how you can use standard vega.js library to realtime update a word cloud.
This is my second version of the static word cloud which I uploaded in my previous repo https://github.com/GDRDABARERA/vegaWordCloudExamples

You can derectly download this pack and put this inside a server and load the index.html file you can preview the real time change of size of words 
with their occurence frequency.

If any issue occurs please put a mail to gdrdabarera@gmail.com ASAP.
